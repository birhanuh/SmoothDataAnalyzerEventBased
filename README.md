Movement Anayzer service
------------------------
>The Movement Analyzer service is composed of two applications. First, a Java application which reads the log file 
generated by the Indoor Localization service and parses, extracts, process the data and store analyzed-results in the 
database. Second, is afront-end web application that reads analyzed data from the database and present relevant
information on the UI (e.g. visitorâ€™s route, maximum spent time per room, not visited locations, etc...). Both, which 
play a key role in studying movement and indoor behavior of the visitors.
