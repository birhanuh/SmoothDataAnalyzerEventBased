play a key role in studying movement and indoor behavior of the visitors.

and stores in the database.
* Design and Implement an HTML5 front-end web application that displays analyzed movement and indoor-activity data on
the UI generated by the Movement Analyzer software.
* Design and Implement a real-time movement monitoring feature in the front-end application.
